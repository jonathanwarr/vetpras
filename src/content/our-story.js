    `When we needed progesterone testing for our beloved pup, we turned to our usual vet, but unfortunately they didn’t offer the service.`,
    `What followed was a frustrating journey of searching for clinics online, sifting through inconsistent information on websites, and making countless phone calls to get quotes and clarify available tests. We didn't realize how few veterinarians offered the service we needed or how drastically prices and service varied from one clinic to another.`,
    `The process was <strong>confusing</strong>, <strong>time-consuming</strong>, and <strong>stressful</strong>.`,
    `That’s why we built <strong>Vetpras</strong> — to take the guesswork out of finding the right vet. By bringing all the information together in one place, we’re on a mission to help pet owners make informed choices with ease and confidence, because no one should have to navigate this level of uncertainty when it comes to their pet’s care.`,
